	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00004": "(Freddy) I still do not see you.",

	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00005": "(Gregory) It's her. She cut you off. She's not going to let you call for help until she finds me.",

	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00014b": "(Freddy) Hello, Gregory. It is me, Freddy. I will escort you to the main entrance. However, I am unable to leave this room. You should have no problem. There is a button on the wall that will open the door to the back room. I will make it accessible to you now.",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00015": "(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. There is an open air vent inside the maintenance room. You will have to climb through the ventilation system and release me from the outside.",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00010": "(Gregory) It's pretty dark in there.",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00016": "(Freddy) There is nothing to be scared of. You can do it.",

Have an awesome night, and we'll see you again soon! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00012": "(Gregory) The stupid door won't open. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00017": "(Freddy) Oh? You are going to need a Photo Pass to open the door. Apologies, I assumed you had one already... Well, you should be able to find one at a convenience counter. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00018": "(Freddy) Good job. Now, please come let me out. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00019": "(Freddy) Way to go, superstar! I knew you could do it. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00020": "(Freddy) I know how to get you out of here. Climb back into my chest cavity. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00021": "(Freddy) There is still time, but we must hurry. If I am spotted, I will certainly be taken back to my room. I will escort you to the main exit through the utility tunnels. It is the safest path. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00013": "(Gregory) Ok. But you better be careful moving around. I don't want to be crushed and twisted into a meat pretzel. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00022": "(Freddy) I am sorry Gregory. I would love to do a tour, but it is closing time and this door is locked. Look for a door with my icon on it. ",

	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00023": "(Freddy) Do not worry Gregory. Even if we are spotted, you are safe with me. She would never suspect we are traveling together. However, we should still do our best to avoid her. If I am sent back to my room, we will never get to the Lobby before midnight. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00024": "(Freddy) I am detecting blood. You are injured. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00024a": "(Freddy) I feel you are broken. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00015": "(Gregory) Don't worry about it. I'm fine. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00015a": "(Gregory) Don't worry about it. I'm fine. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00025": "(Freddy) Your arm is cut badly. I will take you to a first aid station. ",

	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00002": "(Vanessa) Freddy! You're supposed to be on lockdown. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00026": "(Freddy) Officer Vanessa, I do not know how I got here. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00003": "(Vanessa) Well, you totally blew it tonight, you know. Your system crashed and you ruined the show. Now, Parts and Service have you on reduced power. They said it's a safety precaution. Just one more thing to deal with... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00027": "(Freddy) I apologize. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00004": "(Vanessa) Ok... Look, we're like 15 minutes from closing and some kid is sneaking around backstage. If you see anything, notify me immediately. I already alerted the others. Now, go back to your room. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00017": "(Gregory) I told you she was after me. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00028": "(Freddy) I said nothing. I will keep you safe. Let us go. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00018": "(Gregory) Where are we? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00029": "(Freddy) We are now under the Pizzaplex. These utility tunnels connect all the attractions. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00019": "(Gregory) We can go anywhere in the building? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00030": "(Freddy) Correct. Fazer Blast, Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway: they are all accessible to S.T.A.F.F. - with high enough clearance of course. Guests are never allowed down here, but yours is a... special situation. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00031": "(Freddy) I am terribly sorry. The recharge cycle had not yet completed when I found you. You must continue without me. I will guide you on your Fazwatch in case you get into any trouble. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00020": "(Gregory) I don't know if I can do this alone! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00126": "(Gregory) It's Chica. Maybe I could distract her with something. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00001": "(Chica) Bok bok bawk! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00015": "(Chica) This area is off limits. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00032": "(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. You found a security office. You should be quite safe here. The doors were designed to keep our highly-trained security staff safe in the event of an emergency. As long as the doors stay closed, which they will, as long as there is ample power... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00021": "(Gregory) Freddy, the power is only at 15% and they're pounding on the door! How am I going to get out of here? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00033": "(Freddy) Do not panic. You should see an interface on the security desk. Activate it. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00033b": "(Freddy) Do not panic. You should see an interface on the security desk. Hold on while I will make it accessible to you... there. You can now activate security protocols. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00034": "(Freddy) Your Fazwatch is now connected to the security camera system. Check the map on your Fazwatch. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00035": "(Freddy) Those boxes on your mini-map are nearby security cameras. When movement is detected by the camera's motion sensors, you should see red alert icons. Switch between the cameras to find a safe path out of the office and to the main lobby. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00002": "(Intercom) Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex is now closed. Initiating nighttime protocols. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00022": "(Gregory) No. No! Wait! I'm still here! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00023": "(Gregory) Now what am I supposed to do? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00036": "(Freddy) How unfortunate, Gregory. You missed your chance, but there is still hope. You should be able to escape when the security doors reopen at 6:00am. Until then, keep moving and try not to draw attention to yourself. If there is another way out, I will help you find it. I promise. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00037a": "(Freddy) These turnstiles require a Complimentary Pizzaplex Entry Pass. There should be one located near the main entrance. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MOPBOT_00001": "(Mop Bot) The Mega Pizzaplex is closed. Leave the premises or I will be forced to call security. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MOPBOT_00002": "(Mop Bot) Exit the building. This is your final warning. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MOPBOT_00003": "(Mop Bot) Alert. Alert. Security. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00154": "(Freddy) Well done, superstar. You have accessed the Lobby. Unfortunately, that complimentary entry ticket does not allow you to enter the pizzeria. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00155": "(Freddy) You can find an upgrade machine in Customer Service. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00156": "(Freddy) The Atrium is locked. You will need to upgrade your ticket to get inside. Find the upgrade machine in Customer Service. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00024": "(Gregory) This ticket doesn't even work. It says, \"Good for entrance to the lobby shops. Upgrade options available at Customer Service. Also good for one free prize from Glamrock Gifts, while supplies last.\" ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00037": "(Freddy) I wonder what the free prize is? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00025": "(Gregory) Freddy, I found the free gift! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00025a": "(Gregory) It's a crappy Mr. Hippo fridge magnet? Lame. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00038": "(Freddy) I am sorry, Gregory. I am truly sorry. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00026": "(Gregory) It ate my pass! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00039": "(Freddy) Perhaps there is a way to hack it back out. Try Glamrock Gifts. They have lots of trinkets, knickknacks, and doodads. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00107": "(Gregory) My ticket's still stuck. How am I supposed to upgrade my ticket if I can't hack this stupid thing? I should look around some more. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00108": "(Gregory) Maybe there's something in Glamrock Gifts... on the first floor... next to the checkout counter... to the left... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00040": "(Freddy) Try that magnet you found. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00040a": "(Freddy) Try that terrible magnet you found. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00027": "(Gregory) Yes! The magnet scrambled the machine! Aw, man. Now it's some kind of Daycare Pass? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00041": "(Freddy) That is great news! I will meet you in the daycare. The entrance is on the second floor balcony. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00110": "(Gregory) This door needs a Daycare pass. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00042": "(Freddy) Gregory, I am unable to reach you. Check the Daycare security desk for a security badge, then let me in. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00001": "(Sun) Hooo hooo hooo! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00001a": "(Sun) Helloooo! New friend! You're sure up late! Are we having a slumber party? Where are all of your friends? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00001b": "(Sun) We can finger paint, tell stories, drink Fizzy Faz until our heads ex-PLODE and stay up all night! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00001c": "(Sun) There is only one rule: keep the lights on. ON. On... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00002": "(Sun) Hey, hey, are ya having fun yet? Are ya? Are ya? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00002a": "(Sun) No, no no. Where are you going? STAY right here and make crafts! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00003": "(Sun) No, no, no, no! What a mess! Oh, which was the bottom? Where is the top? Clean up! Clean up! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00004": "(Sun) New friend, this- this area is off-limits. You're gonna get us in trouble. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00004a": "(Sun) Don't you want a puppet show? I have glitter glue! Do you like glitter glue? Googly eyes? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00005": "(Sun) No- no! Why would you do that? Lights on! Lights on! I warned you- I WARNED YOU! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MOON_00001": "(Moon) Naughty boy. Naughty boy. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MOON_00001b": "(Moon) It's past your bedtime. You must be punished. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MOON_00001c": "(Moon) Nighty-night. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00157": "(Freddy) Gregory, I do not know what you did, but the lights are out in the Daycare! You need to find the emergency backup generators and turn them on. They are in the play structures. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00028": "(Gregory) I'm not going out there without a flashlight. It's too dark! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00006": "(Sun) Rule-breaker! Rule-breaker! You are banned from the Daycare. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00007": "(Sun) Security alert! Security alert! Wooo! Woooo! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_SUN_00006b": "(Sun) I'm putting you in time out! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00043": "(Freddy) Gregory, Jump in! We need to get out of here now. They have found you! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00044": "(Freddy) Go upstairs. And do not worry, they cannot find you while we are together. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00158": "(Freddy) Go upstairs. We need to head back to the Lobby. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00045": "(Freddy) We are almost out of time. We need to get to a recharge station immediately. Every hour the power is diverted to the recharge stations. When that happens the lights go out, and when <i>that</> happens the Daycare attendant is free to roam the building. It <i>will</> find you. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00046": "(Freddy) Gregory! Where are you going? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00029": "(Gregory) What was that? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00047": "(Freddy) That is a fountain. A fountain is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00030": "(Gregory) Not the fountain! You didn't see the dancing rabbit lady right in front of us? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00048": "(Freddy) No, I did not. There is no rabbit at the Mega Pizzaplex... Not anymore. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00031": "(Gregory) This is crazy. It's like the whole place is trying to get me! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00049": "(Freddy) I am not. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00032": "(Gregory) Why? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00050": "(Freddy) I do not know. I want to help you. Maybe they want to help you too. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00033": "(Gregory) I doubt it. For some reason, you're different. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00051": "(Freddy) Good news. The front doors will open in five hours. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00034": "(Gregory) Good news? Five hours? I'm not gonna last five minutes! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00052": "(Freddy) Do not panic. If we get separated again, you can always call me on your Fazwatch - as long as I have power - and I am able to reach you. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00053": "(Freddy) We should get moving. You can access the main atrium with your new security badge. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00054": "(Freddy) Gregory, I have identified two possible exit points. The main loading dock is located under the food court on the first floor. There is also a fire escape in the third floor Prize Counter. Check your Fazwatch. I will mark both locations on your Faz Map. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MAPBOT_00001": "(Map Bot) Hi! Please take this map. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MAPBOT_00002": "(Map Bot) Take a map. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MAPBOT_00003": "(Map Bot) Free map. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MAPBOT_00004": "(Map Bot) Thank you! Please enjoy. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00055": "(Freddy) It appears that you have no Faz Map. You should be able to obtain one from the greeter on the center balcony. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00056": "(Freddy) It looks like you do not have security clearance to access the kitchen. Find the open vent near the salad bar to bypass security. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00057": "(Freddy) Well done. You are near the Fizzy Faz syrup vats. You should be able to find your way to the Main Kitchen from here. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00035": "(Gregory) Freddy, I can't open any of these doors. I think I am stuck in here. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00058": "(Freddy) Do not panic. Look for the Kitchen Security Office. If you upgrade your security access you should be able to open those doors. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00036": "(Gregory) Freddy, Are you there? I'm trapped! Chica found me and there's only one security door! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00059": "(Freddy) How unfortunate. But I have good news: It looks like you can access the Fazbear online pizza delivery system through that console! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00037": "(Gregory) What? How is that supposed to help? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00060": "(Freddy) Chica loves pizza! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00038": "(Gregory) What won't she eat? I saw her eating out of a trash can earlier. I didn't think robots needed to eat. ",

	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00086": "(Freddy) Do you see a set of controls? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00069": "(Gregory) I think so. There's a funny locked box with a badge on it. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00087": "(Freddy) Those are the loading dock controls. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00087b": "(Freddy) Something is not right. Someone must have changed the permissions. You are going to need a much higher security level to get out that way. Come back to me right away. ",

	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00013": "(Intercom) Emergency lockdown activated. This area is off-limits to guests. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00073": "(Gregory) No, no, no! Freddy! I don't know what happened! All I did was take the badge. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091": "(Freddy) Do not panic. That office is now on lockdown. I can deactivate the alarm, but it will take some time. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091a": "(Freddy) In the meantime, stay where you are. That noise is bound to draw attention. If you leave the office, you will be easier to find. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091b": "(Freddy) If you feel you are in danger, close the doors but you can not keep them closed forever. There is limited power available during a lockdown. If you run out of power, the doors will no longer close. I suggest you only close the doors when absolutely necessary. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091c": "(Freddy) The cameras on your Fazwatch should help. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00092": "(Freddy) All done! See? That was not so bad. If the path looks clear, head to the Prize Counter. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00093": "(Freddy) Go to the back of the Prize Counter. The Fire Escape is in the VIP room. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00063": "(Freddy) You found the Fire Escape. Unfortunately, I do not think there is a way to reach it without becoming a VIP. It is not a very good emergency system. You are lucky there is not a fire. I have lodged a formal complaint. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00040": "(Gregory) Freddy, the doors are all locked! I can't get out of here! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00040a": "(Gregory) Freddy, everything's locked! I can't get out of here! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00064": "(Freddy) Get to the elevator. Find a safe path on your Fazwatch. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00007": "(Vanessa) Move! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00042": "(Gregory) Where am I? Look at all this stuff. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00074": "(Gregory) Freddy? Freddy, are you there? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00043": "(Gregory) I'm trapped. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00008": "(Vanessa) I'll bet you think you're real clever, Gregory. Yeah, I know your name. You're in big trouble! This is <i>not</> the night to be wasting my time. So, you are going to wait right there in Lost and Found until your parents or the police arrive. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANNY_00001": "(Vanny) Are you having fun yet? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00075": "(Gregory) I might be able to get out through this vent but I don't have anything to open it. Maybe there is something in all this junk that could help. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00065": "(Freddy) Gregory... Gregory... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00044": "(Gregory) Freddy, help! That rabbit lady found me! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00066": "(Freddy) If you get this message, come to the Roxy Raceway entrance on the second floor. I piled up some boxes so you can hop over the construction fence and find me. Something is jamming my communications signal. Come to the Roxy Raceway... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00045": "(Gregory) I can hear you! I'm on my way! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00046": "(Gregory) Freddy! Are you ok? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00067": "(Freddy) There you are! I was so worried. I waited and waited for you. I missed the hourly recharge and have been trying to get down to Parts and Service. I think something is wrong. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00047": "(Gregory) Is there anything I can do? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00068": "(Freddy) Help me get to Parts and Service. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00048": "(Gregory) Of course I will! How do we get there? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069": "(Freddy) It is down under the main stage. Normally, the stage lift takes me down there after every concert. That is really the only way I know how. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069a": "(Freddy) Use that door behind me. It will take you to the rehearsal room on the other side of the building. Look for a Backstage Pass then find a way to turn on the lift. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069b": "(Freddy) Good luck, superstar. Entering rest mode. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00049": "(Gregory) Ok. I'll do my best. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00094": "(Freddy) I am sorry, Gregory. I am in no condition to carry you. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00050": "(Gregory) Freddy said I can find a Backstage Pass around here somewhere... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00051": "(Gregory) Got it! Now I should be able to find the lift controls. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00052": "(Gregory) This is backstage? I guess it's why they keep the curtains closed. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00053": "(Gregory) There's something else in here. What's this? It looks... old. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00070": "(Freddy) Gregory? What did you do? Something happened. I can communicate again. I think you fixed my signal. Thank you. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00054": "(Gregory) I can see you on the monitor. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00055": "(Gregory) I didn't think you could stand up. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00071": "(Freddy) Consider it a second wind. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00056": "(Gregory) Freddy, I see Roxy and Monty on the cameras. They're both coming to the office! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00072": "(Freddy) Do not let them in. The security doors are equipped with electrical deterrents. If you see them banging on the doors, hit the appropriate button. The shock should stun them. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00057": "(Gregory) OK, but how do I get out of here? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00073": "(Freddy) Do you see the large vent in the floor? You are probably standing right on top of it. If I can reach the room under you, I should be able to force it open and let you out. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00073a": "(Freddy) All the doors appear to be on lockdown. Hmm... Look for me on the monitors. If you see me waving, push the button in front of the corresponding monitor to open the door. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANNY_00002": "(Vanny) There you are. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANNY_00003": "(Vanny) See you soon! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00074": "(Freddy) Hurry Gregory! I cannot stop her. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00075": "(Freddy) Over here! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00076": "(Freddy) Can you see me? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00077": "(Freddy) Quickly! Open the door. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00078": "(Freddy) Gregory, push the button! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00079": "(Freddy) Jump down! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00058": "(Gregory) Freddy! You saved me! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00059": "(Gregory) I'm so sorry. I couldn't find any lift controls. All I found was this... disk thing. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00080": "(Freddy) Follow me to the atrium. That is a program disk for the stage show. If you use it in the sound booth, you should be able to run a showtime program which will activate the lift. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00081": "(Freddy) Gregory, my systems are failing. Go to the sound booth on the third floor balcony. Run the performance program on that disk then meet me back on the stage. Please hurry. You do not have much time. It is almost the end of the hour. I will wait here. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00060": "(Gregory) I better avoid that spotlight. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00061": "(Gregory) Freddy said the booth is on the third floor. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00062": "(Gregory) Why are there so many more security barriers now? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00062a": "(Gregory) What's with all the security barriers? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00063": "(Gregory) That should do it. I hope Freddy's ok. I should get back to the stage right away. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00082": "(Freddy) Great job superstar. Just push that button and the lift will take us down to Parts and Service. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00064": "(Gregory) Oh no! What time is it? That moon thing's going to get me! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00065": "(Gregory) There! On the wall. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00083": "(Freddy) Quickly. Get to the re-charge station! Follow me. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00066": "(Gregory) Leave him alone! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00127a": "(Gregory) Freddy, can you hear me? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00127": "(Gregory) Freddy's in there. I have to get him out. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00128b": "(Gregory) Ugh! I hate that thing! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00128": "(Gregory) Hmm. It's a map of the utility tunnels. There's a security office nearby. If I can find another Security Badge, I can get into Parts and Service. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00129": "(Gregory) The lift reset. I don't see a way to control it from here. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00130": "(Gregory) It's blocked. I wonder if there's a way around. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00131": "(Gregory) Not again... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00087": "(Gregory) Well, it's a really big room with robot stuff. It's pretty quiet in here. There are these robot skeleton things hanging on hooks. Am I in the right place? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00112": "(Freddy) Look for a security Office. There should be a map and a security badge. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00113": "(Freddy) Those are Endoskeletons. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00088": "(Gregory) So. This is what you look like inside? Creepy. I like you better with your shell on. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00132": "(Gregory) Freddy, there's something here. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00133": "(Gregory) Oh, crap. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00089": "(Gregory) I think that Endo moved. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00114": "(Freddy) That is not possible. You must be mistaken. An Endo cannot function without its shell. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00134": "(Gregory) That wall just moved! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00135": "(Gregory) It's the Security office. Hm. Should be one of those badge head things in here. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00136": "(Gregory) Got it! I can open Parts and Service now. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00136b": "(Gregory) Oh, come on! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00115": "(Freddy) I have never been allowed in here before. This must be where I was born. Look at all the endos. They are all the same... Have I always been a Freddy? Am I Monty with a different shell? What if I am not the first Glamrock Freddy? Are there more of me at other pizzerias? Do we all feel the same? Am I special? If I am mass produced, am I still art? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00115": "(Gregory) Uh. I don't know. I'm just a kid. Maybe we should get you out of here. I don't think it's good for your programming. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00037": "(Vanessa) ... I found him earlier and locked him up in Lost and Found. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_0018": "(Freddy) That is great news. He can be returned to his parents. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00038": "(Vanessa) He can't. Turns out, there's no record of him. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00185": "(Freddy) How unfortunate. If you re-attach my head I will go look for him now. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00039": "(Vanessa) His name is Gregory... You know how I know that? His Fazwatch kept repeating it. In your voice... \"Gregory? Are you there? Gregory?\" ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00186": "(Freddy) Vanessa, all the Fazwatches sound like me. It is the default voice option. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_VANESSA_00040": "(Vanessa) If you're part of this, you're scrap. Monty will run the shows, until Parts and Service can slap your casing on a new Endo. Hang out here for a while. I gotta find that kid. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00187": "(Freddy) Vanessa, do not leave me like this. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00067": "(Gregory) Freddy! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00084": "(Freddy) Gregory! Use the console to let me out. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00018": "(Parts And Service) Please enter the protective cylinder to continue. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00111": "(Gregory) What'd they do to you? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00085": "(Freddy) Routine maintenance. I am functioning much more better... now. Grammar function error... Perhaps I am still not at peak performance. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00188a": "(Freddy) Gregory! I am so glad you are here and alive! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00188": "(Freddy) Could you re-attach my head? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00137": "(Gregory) I dunno. It looks complicated... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00189": "(Freddy) Just reconnect the wires and be careful. I am not quite myself at the moment. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00019": "(Parts And Service) In case of an emergency, the protective cylinder will protect important service personnel outside of the protective cylinder. Deactivating animatronic safety protocols now. It is recommended that no mistakes are made during the procedure. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00020": "(Parts And Service) To reconnect Freddy's head, repeat the correct sequence by pressing the flashing buttons on Freddy's upper body. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00021": "(Parts And Service) Good job. Now, use the testing console to run diagnostics and complete the procedure.. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00022": "(Parts And Service) Good job. Freddy is all patched up and ready for the big show. You may now exit the protective cylinder. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00112": "(Gregory) So, what is this place? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00095": "(Freddy) This is the Parts and Service center. When any of the band members have technical problems, we are sent here for maintenance. We also receive software upgrades... when our behaviors need correction. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00096": "(Freddy) I have something for you. Take it. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00097": "(Freddy) It is a Freddy Fazbear PARTY PASS. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00113": "(Gregory) Where'd it come from? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00098": "(Freddy) I do not know. I was holding it when I rebooted. You can use it to open the gates to one of the many attractions. But it can only be used once. You will have to find additional Party Passes to access the other attractions. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00114": "(Gregory) Really? I can go on any attraction? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00099": "(Freddy) Fazer Blast, Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway...just to name a few. I have marked all locked attractions on your Faz Map. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00076": "(Gregory) Freddy? Check out these pictures. Chica has some sort of special voice box, Roxy has new eyes, and Monty was given better claws. We have to get these! We could upgrade you! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00100": "(Freddy) Gregory, those parts belong to my friends. I would never do anything to hurt them. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00077": "(Gregory) What? All they've done all night is try to hurt me! (under his breath) They get what they deserve. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00101": "(Freddy) There must be a good explanation. They are not capable of hurting a guest. None of us are. It would go against our programming. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00102": "(Freddy) Where are you going? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00078": "(Gregory) Somewhere else. I can't stay here, right? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00103": "(Freddy) Correct. It is just... If we separate for any reason- it is not safe for you down here. It is easy to get lost. You should get a utility map from the warehouse. It is on the other side of the stage lift. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00023": "(Parts And Service) Welcome to Parts and Service. Please select your desired procedure. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00024": "(Parts And Service) Preparing for upgrade procedure. You may now enter the protective cylinder. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00025": "(Parts And Service) Let's begin by opening the arm casing. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00026": "(Parts And Service) Disconnect the colored cables to remove the old forearm. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00028": "(Parts And Service) Great. Now place the new armature into the forearm casing. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00029": "(Parts And Service) With the new armature inserted, reconnect the colored wires. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00030": "(Parts And Service) Great job. Now close the casing. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00031": "(Parts And Service) Well done. There is no need to perform the procedure on the other arm. The auto-assist did it for you. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00032": "(Parts And Service) To access the voice box, we must open Freddy's chest cavity. To unlock the chest cavity, remove Freddy's bowtie. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00033": "(Parts And Service) Good job. Now remove the chest plate. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00034": "(Parts And Service) Well done. Disconnect the throat wires to continue. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00027": "(Parts And Service) It is important that you match the pattern correctly. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00035": "(Parts And Service) Good job. Now connect the throat wires to the replacement voice box. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00036": "(Parts And Service) Well done. Return the chest plate and firmly lock it down with the bowtie. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00037": "(Parts And Service) Looking spiffy. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00038": "(Parts And Service) Commence testing phase. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00039": "(Parts And Service) Testing phase complete. Activating safety protocols. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00040": "(Parts And Service) Let's begin by removing Freddy's face. Press Freddy's nose to remove skull housing. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00041": "(Parts And Service) Carefully detach the ocular connectors. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00042": "(Parts And Service) Good job. Now remove each eye from its respective socket. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00043": "(Parts And Service) Great. Plug the replacement eyes into the open eye sockets. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00044": "(Parts And Service) Well done. Reattach the ocular connector wires. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00104": "(Freddy) My arms are different. Where did you get these parts? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00079": "(Gregory) I'd rather not say. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00105": "(Freddy) How fortunate. I should now be able to smash through the cyclone fences around the building the way Monty does. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00080": "(Gregory) Exactly like he did. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00106": "(Freddy) Gregory. This upgrade... It was Chica's. Please, be honest. How did you get it? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_0008": "(Gregory) When I was in the kitchen earlier, she fell into some sort of garbage smasher. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00107": "(Freddy) Is she ok? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00082": "(Gregory) Well... she's still functional. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00108": "(Freddy) That is a relief. With this new voice box, I should be able to make a vocal pitch that will stun animatronics. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00083": "(Gregory) How are your new eyes? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00109": "(Freddy) I am having a hard time adjusting. You look different to me. I can see movement through the walls. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00084": "(Gregory) Really? I didn't know Roxy could see through walls. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00110": "(Freddy) These are Roxy's eyes?! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00085": "(Gregory) Well, yeah. There was an accident in the raceway. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00111": "(Freddy) Is she ok? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00086": "(Gregory) Nothing seems to stop her. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00138": "(Gregory) There's so much tech stuff in here. Is there anything I could use to stop the other bots? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00190": "(Freddy) Bright lights in the eyes cause us to briefly malfunction. I suppose a Fazerblaster or a Faz Cam could work. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00139": "(Gregory) Where do I get one? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00191": "(Freddy) You can win a Fazerblaster in Fazer Blast. Faz Cams are often confiscated in Monty Golf, but you will need a Party Pass to open one of those attractions. Chica normally gives them out for birthdays. Check her green room in Rockstar Row. You may find one there. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00192": "(Freddy) Use the service elevators at the back of the room. They go up to Rockstar Row. It looks like they are all out of order except for Roxy's. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_ROXY_00052": "(Roxy) It's not your fault. That kid's just lucky. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_ROXY_00053": "(Roxy) We should have found him by now. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_ROXY_00054": "(Roxy) It's not fair. He must be cheating. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_ROXY_00055": "(Roxy) Who's there? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_ROXY_00055b": "(Roxy) It's nothing. Don't get distracted! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_ROXY_00056": "(Roxy) Freddy, get out of my room. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00193b": "(Freddy) I'm going. I'm going. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_ROXY_00057": "(Roxy) Don't be a loser! Get back out there! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00140": "(Gregory) Freddy! I found the party pass! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00193": "(Freddy) Well done. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00141": "(Gregory) Oh, crap! It's that horrible moon thing again! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00194": "(Freddy) Quick, find a recharge station. You should be able to see their locations on the map. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00195": "(Freddy) Gregory, that Party Pass is very special. It will let you into Fazer Blast or Monty Golf. However, it can only be used once. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00142": "(Gregory) What's this? Looks like an old camera. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00196": "(Freddy) Just give it to a Party bot. They usually stay in front of the attractions collecting Party Passes. If you have one, it will let you in. I have marked both locations on your map. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_MONTY_00004": "(Monty) Welcome to Monty's Gator Golf - home of the Hurricane Hole-in-One! We're currently closed for the night. Come back soon! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00197": "(Freddy) Look for the Security Office in the back hallway. Since there is no flash photography allowed in Monty Golf, Faz Cams are often confiscated here. Mainly because they are only sold in Monty Golf. It is a very clever marketing plan. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00198": "(Freddy) That is a Faz Cam. If you are in trouble, use the camera flash to stun the other animatronics. Keep in mind that it will not work on Monty, due to his sunglasses. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00199": "(Freddy) Gregory! What are you doing? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00200": "(Freddy) I cannot see! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00201": "(Freddy) Why, though? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00202": "(Freddy) I am your friend. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00203": "(Freddy) The security office is nearby. You might want to look around the office and see if there is a way to stop Monty from hunting you. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00204": "(Freddy) Gregory! They know you are here. Get the security upgrade and get out! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00205": "(Freddy) Gregory. I do not mean to be intrusive, but I read that message that you found in the security office. There may be a chance to stop Monty from hunting you. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00206": "(Freddy) Monty loves hanging out on the catwalks. You can find the entrance in Mazercise. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00207": "(Freddy) You need to find a Mazercise ticket to get into Mazercise. Check the area. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00208": "(Freddy) You found the Mazercise ticket! Now you can enter Mazercise. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00004": "(Intercom) Welcome to Mazercise! Work off the calories while you eat. Sign up for a membership pass today! Super cool perks include discounts on Pizza, Nachos, Fries and cookies! Now, that's the smell of fitness! ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00093": "(Gregory) Huh. I guess these buttons do something to the maze... ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00156": "(Gregory) These buttons change the maze. I wonder what the right combination is? ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00157": "(Gregory) Someone has to have the right combination written down somewhere. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00209": "(Freddy) So. There is a vent in this maze that leads to the Monty Golf catwalks. I believe there is a control panel for the maze around here somewhere. ",

	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00145": "(Freddy) Suggestion number three; You must stay hidden and keep moving until the Lobby doors open at 6:00am. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00146": "(Freddy) Suggestion number four; You need to hide in a recharge station at the end of every hour. I will meet you there. You can also call me from your Fazwatch at any time to help... as long as I can find you and have power remaining. ",
	"Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00147": "(Freddy) Finally, suggestion number five: Check your Fazwatch cameras for threats and hidden prize boxes. You already have access to the Lobby and Atrium security cameras. Visit other Security Offices to add new camera systems to your Fazwatch. ",
