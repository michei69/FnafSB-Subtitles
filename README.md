## Dumped FNaF SB voice lines from game files
another dumb project of mine. ive only made this since i havent seen any public voicelines from this game. i'll gladly take this down if its considered private stuff

- [x] Original uasset subtitles file
- [x] Cleaned uasset subtitles file
- [x] trash clean-uasset-subtitle-file converter to json
- [x] JSON-format subtitles file
- [ ] HTML-format view subtitles

Locations of original uasset and uexp files are `/Game/Data/Localizations/Loc_Subtitles.uasset` and `/Game/Data/Localizations/Loc_Subtitles.uexp`

If there is something missing please let me know, i've made this in about 2 hours (handmade using vscode)
